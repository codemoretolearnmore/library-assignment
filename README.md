# library-assignment

##This App contains 3 screens
<li>User Profile Screen at path "/" </li>
<li>Users Page to create users at path "/users" </li>
<li>Books Database for librarian to import books and manage at path"/books" </li>
<li>Transactions Done by users at path "/purchase" </li>

<b>As of now to keep it simple, I've taken a user as an example which will be hardcoded in layout.html in localstorage</b>
<li>There is no login/signup screens. I've simple built a page at /users where user can input basic details and user will be created in db. </li>
<li>User can edit profile details by navigating to profile page by navigation menu which will appear on click profile image at top-right side</li>
<li>For librarian to add books/update quantities, he can visit /books path and there will be option to Add book by clicking on Add Btn</li>
<li>Add Btn will pop up a modal which will ask for title of books and no of books to import</li>
<li>For users to purchase book/rent book, can visit to purchase page which will show his past transactions as well</li>

<b>I've Used a free sql server hosting. Using my db credentials, page will through server error multiple times. Although I've tested and checked every api endpoint</b>
